# Explanation of Named Function Expression in JavaScript

The provided code is an example of a named function expression in JavaScript. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

```javascript
// Named Function 
var b = function god(){
    console.log("variable b is called")
}
b(); //variable b is called
god() // index.js:6  Uncaught ReferenceError: god is not defined
      // at index.js:6:2
```

In this code, `b` is a variable that is assigned a function named `god`. This function, when called, logs the string ` “variable b is called”` to the console.

When the function assigned to `b` is called with `b();`, `“variable b is called”` is logged to the console.

However, when an attempt is made to call a function named god with `god()`, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`. This is because `god` is not accessible in this scope. It was defined as part of a function expression assigned to the variable `b`.

In JavaScript, the name of the function in a named function expression is only accessible within the function itself. Outside of the function, it must be referred to by the variable it was assigned to (in this case, b). Hence, calling `god()` results in a ReferenceError.
