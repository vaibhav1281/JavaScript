 **JavaScript Named Function**

In JavaScript, a named function is a function that is declared with a name. This allows the function to be called by its name, rather than having to use an anonymous function.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Named Function
var b = function god() {
    console.log("variable b is called");
};

b(); // "variable b is called"
```

In this example, the function is declared with the name `god`. This means that the function can be called by using the name `god()`.

**Anonymous Function**

An anonymous function is a function that is declared without a name. This means that the function cannot be called by its name, but must instead be called using an anonymous function expression.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Anonymous Function
var b = function() {
    console.log("variable b is called");
};

b(); // "variable b is called"
```

In this example, the function is declared without a name. This means that the function cannot be called by using the name `b()`. Instead, the function must be called using an anonymous function expression, such as `(function() { ... })()`.

**Difference Between Named and Anonymous Functions**

The main difference between named and anonymous functions is that named functions can be called by their name, while anonymous functions cannot. This can be important in some cases, such as when you need to pass a function as an argument to another function.

**When to Use Named Functions**

Named functions should be used when you need to pass a function as an argument to another function. This is because named functions can be called by their name, which makes them easier to use.

**When to Use Anonymous Functions**

Anonymous functions should be used when you do not need to pass a function as an argument to another function. This is because anonymous functions are more concise and easier to read.
